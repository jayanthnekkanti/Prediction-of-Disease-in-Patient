# Prediction of Patient Incare or Outcare Using Random Forest

## Overview
This project predicts whether a patient will need inpatient (incare) or outpatient (outcare) treatment using the **Random Forest Algorithm**. The goal is to help healthcare providers make better decisions about patient care.

## How it Works
We use the Random Forest algorithm, a machine learning technique that builds multiple decision trees based on patient data. These trees help to analyze patterns and make accurate predictions about a patient's treatment type.

## Features
- Predicts if a patient will need incare or outcare treatment.
- Uses patient data like age, medical history, and other factors.
- Employs a powerful ensemble learning method for more accurate results.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/patient-care-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset with patient details.
2. Run the model to predict whether the patient needs incare or outcare treatment.
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Dataset
Ensure your dataset contains relevant patient information like:
- Age
- Medical history
- Previous treatment types
- Other necessary features for prediction

## Random Forest Algorithm
Random Forest is a machine learning model that combines the results of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy. It is particularly useful for classification tasks like predicting incare or outcare patients.
